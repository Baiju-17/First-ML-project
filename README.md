# 🎮 Game Performance Impact Prediction (ML Project)

This is my **first Machine Learning project** built using Python and Scikit-Learn.

## 📌 Project Objective
To predict the **Performance Impact** (Negative / Neutral / Positive) of a user based on:
- Gender
- Occupation
- Game Type
- Primary Gaming Time
- Other numerical features

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Approach
- Data preprocessing using **ColumnTransformer**
- Categorical feature encoding using **OneHotEncoder**
- Target encoding using **LabelEncoder**
- Model training using **RandomForestClassifier**
- Clean workflow using **Pipeline**

## 📊 Model Performance
- Train Accuracy: **100%**
- Test Accuracy: **100%**

*(This accuracy is achieved on the given dataset and mainly for learning purposes.)*

## 📁 Files
- `Game-table.csv` → Dataset
- `ML_Game_Performance.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with full code

## 🚀 What I Learned
- Proper data preprocessing
- Avoiding data leakage
- Using Pipeline for clean ML code
- Converting model output back to real labels

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Try other ML algorithms
- Perform cross-validation
- Improve dataset quality
